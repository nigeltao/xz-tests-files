The nigeltao/xz-tests-files repository is a mirror of binary data (test
files). It combines test files from two git repositories:

- https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz
- https://www.nongnu.org/lzip/

---

The https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz git repository (a mirror of the
canonical xz repository) was recently taken offline. It was compromised and
contains a backdoor:

- https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4

The canonical xz git repository is still online at:

- https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git

As of nigeltao/xz-tests-files's 6e0194063a6dc205d4db35e307778efe1c9f1875,
that repo's mirroring of the xz repo's tests/files directory was most
recently updated by d082a076f3e1da05aa478eac4bbba24744b3a1c0 on 2024-02-13,
the commit immediately prior to 6e0194063a6dc205d4db35e307778efe1c9f1875:

- https://github.com/nigeltao/xz-tests-files/commit/d082a076f3e1da05aa478eac4bbba24744b3a1c0
- https://github.com/nigeltao/xz-tests-files/commit/6e0194063a6dc205d4db35e307778efe1c9f1875

nigeltao/xz-tests-files at 6e0194063a6dc205d4db35e307778efe1c9f1875 does
*not* contain the known-to-smuggle-malicious-payloads test files committed by
Jia Tan on 2024-02-23 and 2024-03-09. It also excludes Jia Tan's possibly
harmless update to the RISC-V test files (also on 2024-03-09). Specifically,
nigeltao/xz-tests-files does not contain these five files:

- `tests/files/bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz`
- `tests/files/bad-dict_size.lzma`
- `tests/files/good-2cat.xz`
- `tests/files/good-large_compressed.lzma`
- `tests/files/good-small_compressed.lzma`

They were added and updated to the xz repo by Jia Tan in:

- https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=commit;h=cf44e4b7f5dfdbf8c78aef377c10f71e274f63c0
- https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=commit;h=6e636819e8f070330d835fce46289a3ff72a7b89

The possibly-harmless RISC-V test files update was:

- https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=commit;h=0b4ccc91454dbcf0bf521b9bd51aa270581ee23c

nigeltao/xz-tests-files does admittedly contain these two files:

- `tests/files/good-1-riscv-lzma2-1.xz`
- `tests/files/good-1-riscv-lzma2-2.xz`

They were added and updated to the xz repo by Jia Tan on 2024-01-22 and
2024-01-23 (and 2024-03-09, as mentioned above, but that's excluded):

- https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=commit;h=e2870db5be1503e6a489fc3d47daf950d6f62723
- https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=commit;h=3060e1070b2421b26c0e17794c1307ec5622f11d

These two files (before or after the 0b4ccc91454dbcf0bf521b9bd51aa270581ee23c
2024-03-09 excluded update) are not believed to be malicious.
